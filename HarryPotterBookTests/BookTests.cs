    /* To try and encourage more sales of the 5 different Harry
        Potter books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer
        discounts of multiple-book purchases.

        One copy of any of the five books costs 8 USD.

        If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5%
        discount on those two books.

        If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.

        If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.

        If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25%
        discount.

        Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are
        different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that
        form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 USD.

        Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the
        price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only
        Harry Potter books), giving as big a discount as possible.

        For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

        2 copies of the first book
        2 copies of the second book
        2 copies of the third book
        1 copy of the fourth book
        1 copy of the fifth book

        Answer: 51.60 USD
